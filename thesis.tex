%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%% Layout %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% German style (no paragraph indent, but gap between paragraphs)
 \setlength{\parindent}{0mm}
% \setlength{\parskip}{4pt plus3pt minus2pt}

% Page width and margins (usually no need to change, just use a4wide package)
% \setlength{\textwidth}{15cm}
% \addtolength{\oddsidemargin}{1mm}
% \addtolength{\evensidemargin}{-13.5mm}
\usepackage{a4wide} % better than individual setup

% For fancyhdr, otherwise it might result in "overfull vbox"
\addtolength{\headheight}{3.5pt}

% URL Prefix for Bibliography (i.e., no prefix, typewriter as font for URLs)
\newcommand{\urlprefix}{}
\def\UrlFont{\small\tt}
%\urlstyle{rm} % oder sf, falls obiges nicht funktioniert


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%% Some useful macros %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \begin{figure}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=#2]{figures/#1.pdf}}
  \caption{#3}

% Floating figures = figures with floating text around: filename width caption

  \begin{floatingfigure}{#2}
    \includegraphics[width=#2]{figures/#1.pdf}
  \caption{#3}
  \label{fig:#1}

% Better verbatim environments (requires fancyvrb package)
\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{myverb}{Verbatim}{fontsize=\small,baselinestretch=0.84}
\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{myverbbox}{Verbatim}{frame=single,fontsize=\small,baselinestretch=0.84}


% For figures and tables
\renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.9} % a page has at most 90% of floats and at least 10% of text (if page contains floats AND text)
\renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.9}
\renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.7} % a page with floats only is at least 70% full

% Hyphenation (include a special file with hyphenation hints if there are problems)
% \include{myhyphen}
